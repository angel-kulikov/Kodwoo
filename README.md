# Kodwoo

A Kohana dwoo view adapter

## About

[Dwoo](http://dwoo.org/) is a template engine, similar to
[Smarty](http://smarty.net), but re-written for PHP5.

Kodwoo allows you to use Dwoo with Kohana 3 with minimal effort. Simply use the
`Kodwoo_View` class instead of `View` or `Kohana_View` like you were used to,
and (by default) name your template files ending in `.tpl` instead of `.php`,
and you're up and running. 

Template parameters are added exactly the same way you would with standard
Kohana views. That is, either supplied to the `Kodwoo_View`
constructor/factory, or by using the view instance's `bind()` and `set()`
routines.

## Configuration

Further customization can be added by adding a *kodwoo* configuration section
to your application or module configuration area. For details of what goes
into this configuration, see `kodwoo/config/kodwoo.php`. Note that some parts
of the configuration can be segmented out to allow different parts of the
application (different modules, for example) to use different dwoo template
configuration options, such as which extension to use or whether to turn on
automatic escaping. Use the `$group` parameter of the `Kodwoo_View` constructor
to specify a which configuration group you want to use, or "default" by default.

## Installation

To install from git, don't forget to update your submodules in order to import
the Dwoo source tree. The process looks something like this (stating from your
Kohana root dir)"

    git submodule add https://tylerl@github.com/tylerl/Kodwoo.git modules/kodwoo
    cd modules/kodwoo
    git submodule update --init

## Notes

Note that for best results, your application's cache directory needs to be
be writable by Kohana.

# Additional Features

Beyond the basic Dwoo and `Kohana_View` functionality, this module adds the
following features:

### User-defined functions
User-defined functions are can be made accessible from templates by using
the `add_plugin()` and `add_remote_plugin()` function within `Kodwoo_View`.
Use `add_remote_plugin("name",$object,"method")` to register a member function
of an external class, or derive from Kodwoo_View and use
`add_plugin("name","method")` to register a member function of the view itself.

### Kohana path inclusion

You can take advantage of the Kohana cascading filesystem within your
templates when using elements such as `{extends}` and `{include}` by prefixing
your filename with a "~". For example, `{include "~errors/404"}` will search
for "application/views/errors/404.tpl", "modules/foo/views/errors/404.tpl",
"system/views/errors/404.tpl", etc.

Omitting the "~" will instruct the template loader to search relative to the
active template's own path, as is the default with Dwoo.

Setting the "root" template file within the `Kodwoo_View` class
*always* uses the cascading Kohana filesystem, even without the "~".
This modified syntax only applies when loading template files from within the
templates themselves.
